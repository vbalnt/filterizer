* Filterizer

** Intro
Using this code, you can start creating your own image filters like
the ones you see in apps like Instagram, Hipstamatic etc.

What you need is Python, and some curve files. To get you started
there is already a sample curve file ( Country.acv ) inside the repo.

Curve files are some special Photoshop files that alter the appearance
of the image. You can find lots of them for free, and there is no need
to have Photoshop installed in order to create filters from them.

For an example of what can be done with =.acv= files take a look at
the following presets [[http://www.digitalfilmactions.com/photoshop-curves/][sample photoshop curves]].

** Photoshop curve files

The code reads a =.acv= file and outputs the polynomials that adjust
the colours of an image. 
There polynomials can then be used to produce filters for images in
every language you prefer.

** Usage

Using the =extractCurvesFromACVFile.py= Python code, you can extract the
polynomials you need, and then you can use them in your code to alter
the image.

** iOS example
There is also an example included on how to use a curve extracted from
an =.acv= file in objective-C.
Warning: The iPhone code is slow and unoptimized. It is mainly intented as a proof of concept.

** Python filtering example
 Github user @pfdevilliers has wrapped together a nice python script using the
 curve reading code above. Take a look [[https://github.com/pfdevilliers/python-image-filters][here]].
